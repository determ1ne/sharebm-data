There’s very little in popular sources about experimentally measuring and verifying the effect of capacitor networks.  A circuit board typically receives power from a source off-board and then passes it through a voltage regulation module to provide a steady voltage to the rest of the board. A circuit board’s power distribution network (PDN) consists of everything between the voltage regulator and the power-consuming devices on the board, including bulk and decoupling capacitors, traces, and power planes and interconnecting vias. The purpose of the PDN is to deliver clean, low-noise voltage to the rest of the circuit board. Voltage noise on the PDN is the result of transient currents passing through the impedance of the PDN, and the goal in PDN design is to provide an acceptably low impedance from DC to the highest frequency of interest for the circuit.  The standard for measuring PDN impedance is a vector network analyzer (VNA) in a two-port shunt-thru connection [3]. VNAs are very expensive and most are designed for applications in radio and microwave communications rather than general impedance analysis (frequency ranges going up into the tens of gigahertz, but bottoming out at hundreds of kilohertz or the low single-digit megahertz range). I’ve been exploring using a more humble setup of a spectrum analyzer and tracking generator to get good results, as long as some reasonable assumptions hold."},{"title":"The basics of decoupling capacitors","tags":["electronics"],"url":"https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-decoupling-capacitors","cache":"ad972c9616890a3869214189729da5d7.html","comment":"Some contents may be not accurate.

Today, you can accomplish the same with a single chip and a dozen passives. Heck, you might even get Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for free.  One of the few discrete components that survive and thrive in the face of growing integration is the humble decoupling capacitor. It’s not just that the device is hard to manufacture on the die of an integrated circuit; in the world high data speeds and low supply voltages, it has an increasingly important role to play in keeping the circuits humming along."},{"title":"The basics of decoupling capacitors | Hacker News","tags":["hacker news","electronics"],"url":"https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-decoupling-capacitors","cache":"9bc20637af34a301a82f898ea0c14586.html","comment":"","hint":""},{"title":"Rules of static linking: libstdc++, libc, libgcc (2012)","tags":["linking","libc"],"url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20160707024836/https://micro.nicholaswilson.me.uk/post/31855915892/rules-of-static-linking-libstdc-libc-libgcc","cache":"4873795f7b09327369bb03dec8efd31b.html","comment":"Contents may not be accurate.

While I initially had little access to the latest technologies, everything shifted with the beginning of the decade. By chance, I had the opportunity to own a very high performance computer for the time being. It was an 80386SX CPU-based machine, running at 25 MHz. Further equipment included 2 Mb RAM, integrated AcuMOS AVGA2 card with 256 K graphics memory, and a 40 Mb Seagate hard disk drive. All packed in a Kenitec branded desktop case and connected to a 12\" AOC monochrome VGA monitor. I discovered modern operating systems, games, and -- drum roll, please -- computer programming. This is the context that marked my life in terms of computers. It changed it completely, shifting my perspective to 180 degrees."},{"title":"Go Does Not Need a Java Style
